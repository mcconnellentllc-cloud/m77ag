# Palmer Amaranth Control Program for Corn
## Northeastern Colorado | Corn Following Wheat

---

## Overview

**Target Weed:** Palmer amaranth (pigweed)
**Crop:** Corn
**Previous Crop:** Wheat
**Location:** Northeastern Colorado
**Total Passes:** 4
**Program Cost:** $17.55 - $20.89 per acre

Palmer amaranth is the #1 most problematic weed in corn production due to:
- Rapid growth (up to 3 inches per day in summer)
- High seed production (up to 1 million seeds per female plant)
- Multiple herbicide resistances
- Competition that can reduce yields by 50-90%

- Use standard flat fan nozzles

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Spray when weeds are actively growing
- Good coverage is essential
- Clean equipment after application

---

### Pass 2: Pre-Plant Burndown (April 1)
**Timing:** 2-3 weeks before planting
**Target Date:** Approximately April 1
**Purpose:** Spring burndown of winter annuals and early Palmer emerges

**⚠️ THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT APPLICATION ⚠️**

**Critical Success Factors:**
- DO NOT SKIP this application
- Must have rainfall/irrigation within 7-10 days for activation
- Apply to clean, prepared seedbed
- Use Valor SX for budget-conscious program
- Use Sulfentrazone for extended control (heavier soils, later planting)
- Both products provide multiple modes of action for resistance management

### Pass 4: Post-Emerge (June 3)
**Timing:** Corn V3-V6 stage (8-18 inches)
**Target Date:** Approximately June 3
**Purpose:** Control escapes and extend residual

| Product | Rate/Acre | Purpose | Cost/Acre |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **RT3** (Glyphosate) | 22 oz | Control escapes | $0.81 |
| **Dicamba DMA** | 16 oz (0.5 lb) | Broadleaf control | $0.88 |
| **Aatex** (Atrazine) | 32 oz (1 qt) | Extended residual | $2.67 |

**Total Cost:** $4.36/acre

**Application Details:**
- Temperature: 50-85°F (avoid >85°F)
- Corn stage: V3-V6 (before V8)
- Palmer stage: 1-3 inches (CRITICAL - before 4 inches)
- Water volume: 15-20 gallons/acre
- TTI or AIXR drift reduction nozzles
- Add AMS + crop oil or MSO

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Scout fields weekly starting at emergence
- Apply when Palmer is SMALL (<3 inches)
- Palmer control drops dramatically after 4 inches
- Only use glyphosate in Roundup Ready corn
- Only use dicamba in Xtend/dicamba-tolerant corn
- Follow all dicamba label restrictions for drift prevention
- Apply early morning or evening to avoid high temperatures
- Do not apply if wind >10 mph

## Scouting & Management

### Weekly Scouting Schedule

**Week 5-6:** Scout for escapes, plan post-emerge timing
**Week 7-8:** Post-emerge application window
**Week 9-canopy closure:** Continue scouting for late flushes

### Action Thresholds

| Palmer Size | Action Required | Expected Control |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **<1 inch** | Continue monitoring | 95-100% |
| **1-3 inches** | Spray immediately | 90-95% |
| **3-4 inches** | Emergency spray | 70-85% |
| **>4 inches** | Very difficult | 40-60% |

**⚠️ DO NOT LET PALMER GET ABOVE 3 INCHES ⚠️**

## Equipment Cleaning

Palmer amaranth seeds are easily spread via equipment. Follow these steps:

1. **Between fields:** Blow off all plant material
2. **Weekly:** Pressure wash equipment
3. **Focus areas:** Combines, planters, cultivators, sprayers
4. **Clean first:** Start with clean fields, end with infested fields

---

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ DO:
- Apply pre-emerge herbicides (Pass 3) - NEVER SKIP
- Use multiple modes of action
- Control Palmer when small (<3 inches)
- Scout fields weekly
- Clean equipment between fields
- Follow all label directions
- Keep good records

### ❌ DON'T:
- Skip the pre-emerge application
- Rely on post-emerge only
- Wait until Palmer is large (>4 inches)
- Use same mode of action repeatedly
- Apply dicamba off-label or in drift conditions
- Spread seeds via equipment

---

## Expected Results

### With Proper Execution:
- **85-90% control** with Standard Program
- **90-95% control** with Premium Program
- Clean fields at harvest
- Reduced seed bank for future years

### If Program Fails:
Most failures occur from:
1. Skipping pre-emerge application
2. No rainfall within 10 days of pre-emerge
3. Delaying post-emerge until weeds too large
4. Using single mode of action
5. Poor spray coverage
